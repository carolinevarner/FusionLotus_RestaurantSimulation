# Project1_CS3502

This repository contains two projects:
1. **IPC Project**: Demonstrates Inter-Process Communication (IPC) using named pipes in C#.
2. **Threading Project**: Simulates a restaurant order processing system using multi-threading in C#.

## IPC Project
- **Files**: `ChefLogger.cs`, `LogReader.cs`
- **Description**: This project implements a producer-consumer pattern using named pipes to facilitate real-time data exchange between two processes.

## Threading Project
- **Files**: `LotusFusionRestaurant.cs`
- **Description**: This project simulates a restaurant kitchen with multiple chefs processing orders concurrently using threads.

## How to Run
- Clone the repository and open the solution in Visual Studio.
- Build and run the projects to see the IPC and threading implementations in action.
